# AssemblyPong
A bootable 'extended' version of Pong, featuring elements of randomness, multiple pong balls, and a more involved scoring system. Developed in x86 AT&T Assembly.

Done as a bonus project for the TU Delft's CSE1400 Computer Organisation course.

## How to play
To run, follow the instructions for the excellent [gamelib-x64](https://github.com/thegeman/gamelib-x64) bootable game library, using the `game.s` file in this repository.
